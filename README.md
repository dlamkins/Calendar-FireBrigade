# Calendar FireBrigade

A niche tool for a very specific calendar use case.

This tool might be helpful to you if you answer yes to all of the following questions (or can modify your procedures to say yes to all of the following questions):
- You have a team of individuals with meetings scheduled on a shared team calendar.
- These meetings are typically on their own calendar before they're copied over to the team calendar.
- These meetings have a reliable naming convention that can be matched via RegEx.
- You use a category to represent each member of your team.
- You have explicit read access to each of your team members' calendars.
- You use Outlook to manage your calendar.

If the answer to all of the above questions is yes, then the following is possible with this tool:
- You can automatically sync all of your team member events to the shared calendar without them needing to manually duplicate the events.
- You can quickly find availability for calls on the calendar that takes into account each team members availability, recharge times, training, OOO, lunch, etc.

If the answer to any of the above questions is no, then you likely will not find much use from this tool or may wish to revise your procedures to make this tool relevant.
